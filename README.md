Images & more info about the project can be found on [**my portfolio**](https://www.alantran.me/projects/honeybrace)!

The winner of UC Berkeley's 2024 Maker Design Studio Expo, this is a prototype knee brace built to support leg movement while walking. The product was designed over a 2 month long period with a team of 5 students from UC Berkeley. 

The knee brace features a 60kgcm servo motor capable of providing supplemental power to the knee while moving. A flex sensor provides input on the position of the knee and allows the motor to respond accordingly. This repository contains the CAD models and code involved with the creation of the project.
